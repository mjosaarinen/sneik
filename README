- 2019-05-20: Updated from SNEIK v1.0 to SNEIK v1.1 on  The new version 
  adopts the additional circular rotation fix suggested by LÃ©o Perrin.
- 2019-08-18: Added RISC-V (RV32I) assembler, updated to faster ARMv7 code.

This is the source code package for the SNEIK v1.1 family of lightweight
cryptographic algorithms.

Root level files:

    sneik_spec.pdf      Algorithm specification and supporting documentation.
    testkat.sh          Verify "ref" and "opt" implementations against KAT.
    genkat.sh           Generate KAT files (you don't need to do this).
    LICENSE             License for this implementation.

Source code and test vectors for SNEIKEN AEADs:

    crypto_aead/sneiken128/ ref opt avr armv7 rv32i LWC_AEAD_KAT_128_128.txt
    crypto_aead/sneiken192/ ref opt avr armv7 rv32i LWC_AEAD_KAT_192_128.txt
    crypto_aead/sneiken256/ ref opt avr armv7 rv32i LWC_AEAD_KAT_256_128.txt

Source code and test vectors for SNEIKHA hash functions:

    crypto_hash/sneikha256/ ref opt avr armv7 rv32i LWC_HASH_KAT_256.txt
    crypto_hash/sneikha384/ ref opt avr armv7 rv32i LWC_HASH_KAT_384.txt

Each directory has a "ref" portable reference implementation, somewhat smaller
"opt" optimized version (which assumes that the platform is little-endian) and
versions utilizing assembly-optimized permutations: "avr" for 8-bit Atmel AVR,
"armv7" for 32-bit ARMv7(-m), and "rv32i" for 32-bit base RISC-V ISA.

Each directory furthermore contains test vectors generated with NIST's
standard `genkat_aead.c` and `genkat_hash.c` programs. Most of the source
code is usually symlinked from the "common" directory:

    common/sneik_f512   Implementations of the sneik_f512() permutation.
    common/ref_blnk     Reference implementation, using BLNK2 code.
    common/opt          Smaller implementations for the single-call API.
    common/nist         NIST's headers and KAT generation code.
